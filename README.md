## Description
For this challenge, I was asked to create a simple ToDo app. The backend had to be built with a combination of a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database and [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/). The front end was left up to me. I choose to use this opportunity to explore [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Features
- A user is able to create, view, edit, and delete a task.
- A user can mark a task complete. (This functionality is not yet complete - Ran into some issues with how to get a React component to make a PUT request to toggle a boolean on a click event.)

## Schema
The database schema is a simple one to many relationship between a Users table and Tasks table.

## Reflections
### Roses:
  Going into this project I was unfamiliar with [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) and had little experience with [React](https://reactjs.org/). I am excited to have had the introduction to [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) and now have a good understanding of both how to use it and when it is the best tool for the job. Additionally, I am excited about the amount of new knowledge I have gained in the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework.

### Thorns:
  I have had many irons in the fire and feel this has caught up to me in the form of having less time to give due diligence to everything. I am going to take this as a sign to dial back my commitments in order to give the greatest focus to my highest priorities. My enthusiasm to learn new technologies is a double edged sword. I had the option to build the front end in any framework and I eagerly jumped at the opportunity to build it in React - a framework I have little experience with. Ultimately I am glad I did, however, this resulted in me moving slower as I learned the nuances of a new framework and ultimately left the project with one piece of core functionality not working. Given more time I would go back and implement authentication/authorization functionality as I am not particularly excited about my work-around for having a multiple users. 

### Buds:
  I keep coming up with new use cases for using Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) in future IOT projects and am excited to see those come to fruition. I am also currently using the skills I gained in [React](https://reactjs.org/) to implement new features on my current contract gig. I am looking forward to looking back in a short time and seeing how far I have come.
