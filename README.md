## Description
For this challenge, I was asked to create a simple ToDo app. The backend had to be built with a combination of a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database and [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/). The front end was left up to me. I choose to use this opportunity to explore [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Features
- A user is able to create, view, edit, or delete a task.
- A user can mark a task complete. (This functionality is not yet complete - Ran into some issues with how to get a React component to make a PUT request to toggle a boolean on a click event.)
